# 12 Katas of Christmas

12 katas [Simple, self contained problems], 1 released every day of Christmas.

To play:

  1. Write solution
  2. Optionally fork this repo, commit your implementation & file a PR


For more info on what Katas are, see [here](http://codekata.com/) or have a Google :)

The objective of a kata is to solve it yourself and learn from the process. While Git & GitHub arenâ€™t part of that process, you may find it interesting to submit your solutions in a PR to this repository. More info on that process is available [here](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).
